# Rudi-s-Route-Optimization-Modelling
 Focusing on Rudi's Bakery, I optimized their Direct Store Delivery (DSD) routes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). This approach increased delivery frequency, operational efficiency, and reduced costs, enhancing sales and customer satisfaction.
